# WingTsun
This is a repo for the development of WingTsun Lang!
---
## Introduction
WingTsun is a High-performance domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Python, for a variety of applications which have the core of GEMM. 
I want to provide extensive support for **mixed-precision** computations, supporting specialized data-movement and multiply-accumulation abstraction 
for half-precision floating point (FP16), BFloat16 (BF16), Tensor Float32 (TF32), single-precision floating point (FP32), double-precision floating point
(FP64) types, integer data types (4b and 8b), and binary data types (1b).

It will use Tensor Core on NVIDIA's Volta, Turing and Ampere architectures.
